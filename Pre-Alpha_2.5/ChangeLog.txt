Change log for next release Hydra renderer v2.5

BREAKING CHANGES:



FEATURES:
28_12_2019 - Anisotropic BRDF: Beckmann and GGX.
28_12_2019 - Falloff.
28_12_2019 - Blended box (triplanar mapping).
28_12_2019 - AO (ambient occlusion). See current limitations.
28_12_2019 - DOF for all GI algorithms. (there are still artifacts).
28_12_2019 - BRDF clamp.
28_12_2019 - Support for disabling texture filtering (important for anisotropy rotation textures).



IMPROVEMENTS:
16_01_2020 - Better GGX sampling (Heitz 2017).
28_12_2019 - Better selection mesh of the Hydra light.
03_09_2019 - Contrast does not oversaturate colors.
21_08_2019 - A large number of materials does not slow down the mat. editor.
22_08_2019 - Better selection mesh of the sun.



BUG FIXES:
16_01_2020 - The V-Ray converter script does not work when using anisotropy.
28_12_2019 - When the 3D render falls, max freezes.
28_12_2019 - Transparency of the material with the back/Envir node.
28_12_2019 - Sometimes there are Nan pixels with a normal map.
03_09_2019 - Different brightness of the hydra light in different system units of the scene.
22_08_2019 - Fixed crash 3D max during the rotation of the sun through the GUI.
21_08_2019 - Hydra light disappears in viewport.
and various small bugs.



LIMITATIONS:
* Falloff, blended box, and AO cannot be embedded in each other.
* In falloff, only color works.
* Blend box for relief (bump) works only with normal maps.
* Blended box has a texture in the world space, so it is not suitable for animated objects. The texture will stand still.
* AO only 2 cards per material.
* AO in convexity mode works only if there is an AO in concavity mode (bug).
* Texture slots do not work in AO.
(But they can be put in a blend and mix any two materials.)
* Since this is a preliminary test version, there is no installer.

Gradually, all the restrictions will be fixed.
